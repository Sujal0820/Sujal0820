# Sujal Jamsandekar
Cloud DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Automation | Reliability-Focused Systems

I design and automate reproducible cloud infrastructure with a focus on resilience, failure recovery, and operational reliability.

My primary work centers around building production-oriented systems using Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized deployments.

---

## Engineering Focus

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions)
- Containerized Deployments (Docker)
- AWS EC2 & Networking
- Linux System Management
- Failure Simulation & Recovery
- Cost-Aware Cloud Deployment

## Featured Project

### Self-Healing Cloud Application Platform

A production-oriented cloud system designed to automatically recover from failures and minimize manual operational intervention.

#### Architecture Overview
- Infrastructure provisioned using Terraform
- Dockerized backend application
- Deployed on AWS EC2
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Health-check based restart strategy
- Simulated failure testing and recovery validation

#### Engineering Objectives
- Eliminate manual deployment steps
- Ensure infrastructure reproducibility
- Validate automatic service recovery
- Understand operational behavior under failure conditions

#### Failure Scenarios Tested
- Container crash simulation
- Manual process termination
- Service restart validation
- Deployment re-trigger via CI/CD

#### Key Learnings
- Importance of health checks in resilient systems
- Infrastructure reproducibility using Terraform
- CI/CD pipeline stability under repeated deployments
- Trade-offs between cost and redundancy

## Infrastructure Philosophy

- Infrastructure should be fully reproducible.
- Systems must be designed assuming failure.
- Automation reduces human error.
- Monitoring should guide scaling decisions.
- Operational simplicity improves reliability.
